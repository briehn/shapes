# shapes
A project for my Intro. to Computer Science course that asked for students to "Write a program to model a generic shape and a list of specific shapes such as a rectangle, a triangle, and a circle. Test each class with its own driver. Create a helper class with helper methods that the driver program will use for testing all classes. "
